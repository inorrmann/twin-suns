              The Marrowhawk came down hard in the sands of Sallak, throwing up a storm of dust. As the settlers
              stumbled out, coughing and blinking against the light of two moons, the world stretched before them:
              endless dunes broken by jagged cliffs of black stone.

              It was there, half-buried at the edge of the crash site, that they found it — an ancient monolith,
              taller than a man and carved with geometric runes that pulsed faintly as they approached. The surface
              seemed to hum, vibrating with unseen energy. Some claimed it was a relic of the Old Republic.
              Others whispered that it resonated with the Force.

            <br/>
            <p className="text-left">
              Whatever its origin, the settlers soon realized the monolith held a secret. Symbols carved into its
              face formed a shifting grid, the patterns changing as if testing their perception. Only by aligning
              the runes correctly could the monolith’s message be unlocked.

            <p className="text-left">
              Kneeling in the dust, the pioneers traced the glowing lines with gloved fingers, murmuring to one
              another as they pieced together the logic of the grid. Something ancient — and powerful — had marked
              Sallak long before they had arrived.
