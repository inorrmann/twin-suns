              The crash site yielded more than sand and jagged stone. As the settlers scouted outward, they discovered a
              corroded durasteel hatch half-buried beneath a dune. Scratched into its surface, almost erased by time,
              was the unmistakable symbol of the Rebellion.

              With effort, they pried it open. Inside lay a narrow chamber of cold durasteel walls, its consoles
              flickering faintly. A forgotten Rebel listening post. Sand poured through the cracks, coating the
              floor in red dust, but one terminal still flickered with life.

              It was clear: the Rebels had been here before, but for some reason they never returned.
              The settlers realized they might hold valuable intelligence, but the system was locked.
              A cryptogram protected its records, perhaps the only way to keep the Empire from uncovering
              what was hidden here.
